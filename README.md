# Income-Inequality-Analysis
One of the biggest problems facing countries all around the world is income inequality. Income Inequality represents the inequality in the distribution of income throughout all residents in a country. High income inequality is generally linked to a worse country overall, and in general lower income inequality is advocated for. This statistical study analyzed how various factors could affect the economic health of a nation. 

The gini index is a useful tool to determine the income inequality of a country. A Gini coefficient of 0 would represent complete equality in the income of the population, and a Gini coefficient of 100 would represent complete inequality in the income of the population, where one person collects all the income.
