# Income-Inequality-Analysis
One of the biggest problems facing countries all around the world is income inequality. Income Inequality represents the inequality in the distribution of income throughout all residents in a country. High income inequality is generally linked to a worse country overall, and in general lower income inequality is advocated for. This statistical study analyzed how various factors could affect the economic health of a nation. 

The gini index is a useful tool to determine the income inequality of a country. A Gini coefficient of 0 would represent complete equality in the income of the population, and a Gini coefficient of 100 would represent complete inequality in the income of the population, where one person collects all the income. 

One research question to be asked is whether an increase in country investment would lead to less income inequality. However, when looking at data from 2017, it can be determined that simply increasing investment does not lead to a decrease in income inequality. 

When mapping 2017 data onto a regression plot, there looks to be no correlation between a nation's investment as % of GDP and their gini index.

When looking at the countries with the least income inequality, their investment as % of GDP is sparse.
