# Income-Inequality-Analysis
One of the biggest problems facing countries all around the world is income inequality. Income Inequality represents the inequality in the distribution of income throughout all residents in a country. High income inequality is generally linked to a worse country overall, and in general lower income inequality is advocated for. This statistical study analyzed how various factors could affect the economic health of a nation. 

The gini index is a useful tool to determine the income inequality of a country. A Gini coefficient of 0 would represent complete equality in the income of the population, and a Gini coefficient of 100 would represent complete inequality in the income of the population, where one person collects all the income. 

One research question to be asked is whether an increase in country investment(capital formation) would lead to less income inequality. However, when looking at data from 2017, it can be determined that simply increasing investment does not lead to a decrease in income inequality. 

When mapping 2017 data onto a regression plot, there looks to be no correlation between a nation's investment  as % of GDP and their gini index.

When looking at the countries with the least income inequality, their investment as % of GDP is sparse.

When looking at countries with the most income inequality, their investment as % of GDP is also sparse.

The results show that there are other factors to lead to less income inequality that are more important that simply the investment made by a country. In other words, increasing the capital formation in a nation does not translate to less income inequality.

Another research question to be asked is if there is a correlation between the tax revenue of a country and its income inequality. When looking at data from 2016, it can be determined that there is no correlation between tax revenue and income inequality.

When mapping the 2016 data onto a regression plot, there is shown no correlation between the gini index and tax revenue as % of GDP.

The results indicate that there are other factors that change the income inequality of a country than just tax revenue. Increasing the tax revenue of a country will not in of itself lead to a decrease in income inequality, and vice versa.

A third research question to explore is whether there is a correlation between the quality of the democracy of a country and its income inequality. A way to measure the quality of a democracy is through the EIU Democracy Index, which represents the quality of a nation's democracy as a number between 0 and 100. When looking at data from 2016, it can be determined that there is no correlation between democracy and income inequality.

When mapping the 2016 data onto a regression plot, there is shown no correlation between the gini index and a nation's democracy.
